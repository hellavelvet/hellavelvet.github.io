            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
              Voiceball is like foosball played with your voice. Using
              microphones, players hit the ball with a waveform representation
              of their voice. Make sounds to create waves to hit the ball into
              the other player's goal in this party game pitting your vocal
              skills against your friends.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              We started developing Voiceball at the 2017 Global Game Jam, where
              the theme was “waves.” This made us think about audio waves,
              microphones, and a sports analog to setup a familiar premise.
              Foosball seemed like a great choice. We could replace the football
              players with interesting waveform visualizations. Also we could
              also work from one input, a player’s voice.
              <br /><br />
              We found from the first iteration that people got creative with
              the game. Some people rapped, some screamed, sung, or howled. Most
              people seemed to laugh. We loved the reactions we got and began to
              get invites to events to showcase the game. This made us feel we
              were onto something, so we continued to work on the game.
              <br /><br />
              We've shown Voiceball at many events in our hometown of Atlanta,
              GA and in the Southeast. These include Dreamhack, Indie Bits,
              MomoCon, SIEGE, Southern Fried Gaming Expo, and Terminus. After
              each event we improved the game based on the feedback we received.
              In 2018 we showed Voiceball at Alt.Ctrl.GDC.
            </p>
            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
              When people play Voiceball, we want them to feel goofy. The
              silliness of a group of people making strange noises to compete
              against each other is our goal. We want players to have the
              freedom to use their voice in a way they don’t day-to-day. People
              have agency through their voice. They speak and sing for many
              reasons. To impart ideas, gain leverage in situations, entertain,
              intimidate, entice, and console others. Voiceball offers players
              the ability to explore how to use their voice in a video game.
              <br /><br />
              It turns out that using your voice to control a game is surprising
              physical. To make precise shots, players need to control their
              pitch. As a result, this is a game of skill that involves an
              element of performance. At events it’s almost theatrical, as
              people gather around to watch. They want to see how other players
              use their individual vocal skills in the game. Strong vocalists
              impress with their wide vocal range and arsenal of techniques.
              This gives them great control of the ball on the field. Less
              talented vocalists often play to the crowd: belting, screaming, or
              commanding the ball forward. It is most fulfilling when a shyer
              player breaks out of their shell and lets their competitive edge
              take over.
            </p>
            <h3>Innovation</h3>
            <p>
              There have been digital games controlled by microphones. Yet few
              have required control of pitch outside of the context of singing.
              Voiceball pushes the boundaries of the exciting possibility space
              of pitch based games. This is a space ripe for innovation as many
              devices have microphones. It is also an accessible space, where
              complex button controls are not required. <br /><br />
              One of the most interesting challenges we faced relates to how
              personal one’s voice is. We want to accommodate this personal
              connection. In earlier versions of the game some players couldn’t
              affect all parts of the field. This was because their vocal range
              didn't quite fit the range we provided. This unfortunately left
              some players feeling cheated. Because of this, we developed a
              system that adapts to each player's unique vocal range. Voiceball
              also adapts to quiet or loud players and environments. Empowerment
              by using one’s voice is one of our key goals, and we strive to
              include as many people as possible.
